faq:
  - question: Am I eligible to attend a Brainhack Global event?
    answer: |
      Yes! Everyone is invited! Brainhack events welcome researchers from every academic background and career stage interested in the brain. Each local event is encouraged to accept participants from diverse backgrounds. Although previous knowledge of neuroscience analysis software tools and methods is beneficial, it is not a requirement, and participation in Brainhack events can take on many forms. In summary, if you want to get involved, there’s a place for you.

  - question: Where can I find a list of broadcast, (synchronized) talks/workshops across local Brainhack Global events worldwide?
    answer: |
      During the Brainhack Global event, you will be able to get more information about and follow broadcasts from the local sites via a Google Calendar which will be listed in the Brainhack Global 2019 webpage during the event period. Materials associated with the tutorials and talks will also be available on the hosting event’s website.

  - question: Will Brainhack Global or local event sites provide funding to attendees?
    answer: |
      Unfortunately, Brainhack Global is a volunteer initiative that has limited funding sources. However, some of the local events may offer funding opportunities. To find out more, please check the local events’ websites.

  - question: What should I do if I encounter/encountered an action/abuse that violates the Code of Conduct?
    answer: |
      Understanding and applying the Code of Conduct is the main responsibility of the organizers and all the attendees. Any action that violates the Code of Conduct should be immediately reported to the appointed personnel of the local organizational committee. If you are uncomfortable communicating with the local organizers, or if you feel that their response is inadequate, you are welcome to contact the Brainhack Global team at brainhackorg@gmail.com. Please do not forget that the Brainhack Global team is ready to support you and that you are not alone. Reporting offensive behavior will not only stop it from happening to you, but it will also prevent it from happening to others, and it will help to maintain an open and diverse culture in the community. The Brainhack Global team has your back!

  - question: May I pitch a project? Do I have to? Which procedure do I have to follow?
    answer: |
      Every attendee is entitled to pitch a project. It might be either a project they are already working on, or  a project they would like to receive contribution/opinion/help, or a completely new project they would like to accomplish with group work. It is always recommended to propose your project through the registration period by providing a short summary/aim of your project, which would be helpful to the local event hosts in organising the event. However, you can also come up with your project on the first day of the event.

      When you propose a project make sure that it has a rough plan about the amount of work that needs to be done and that it has clear goals that can be (partly) achieved during the (short) amount of time you are provided with. Afterwards, further collaboration is encouraged to finalize the project. If your project involves coding make sure that your codes, README documents, and materials are stored on an open-access reposition; hence the attendees who would like to join your project can quickly go over them and start helping/contributing as soon as possible.

      Since you won’t have any knowledge about the expertise profile of the other Brainhack attendees until the hackathon starts, it is better to incorporate some flexibility into your project plan and schedule. Because there is always a possibility of getting help from any number of attendees on many different aspects of your project that you didn’t plan ahead. Please do not undermine the contribution that would come from any of the attendees at the event. This is one of the important parts of the event. Be inclusive and open to the contributions. Especially if they come from an early career researcher and he/she is there to learn from you; please do not forget that you were one of them once too and that providing people with an environment to learn and improve themselves is one of the main goals and gains of the event. And again you would never be able to know which contribution an attendee could provide you with. Therefore, it is always better to keep yourself open to different ideas and contributions and to let the brainstorming help you achieve your project’s goals.

      Depending on the Brainhack local event site, you might be asked to give a short presentation of your project (usually on the first day of the event) to inform attendees about the project aim(s) and the tasks to be done. Please prepare a short and clear presentation in accordance with the plan of the event site of your choice. Gather your team, and let the magic happen!

  - question: Do I have to use open science tools to pitch a project?
    answer: |
      We recommend and support the use and application of open science tools and methodologies. Using open science tools will bring transparency in proceedings, foster the efficacious implementation of methods, and increases the audibility and reproducibility of the proceedings.

      However, you might already have ongoing projects that use non-open science/source tools due to the specs or requirements of the project. This platform could also provide you with the opportunity to seek advice on how to implement those projects using open science tools. Any project for the good of the community, facilitating other’s research by making it reproducible and open is welcomed.
