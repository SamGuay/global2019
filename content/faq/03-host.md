  - question: Are we eligible to host a local Brainhack event as part of Brainhack Global?
    answer: |
      Yes! You do not have to have a big team or extensive attendee list. Sometimes event sites might not even come up with their projects. On those occasions, you might provide the attendees with tutorials, or you can watch simultaneously presented tutorials from other event sites and run brainstorming sessions to discuss the implementability of the presented methods in your research. 

      One thing to remember is that regardless of your event’s size, you always need a good supporting team working alongside you. Because, as you can read from the How to Guideline, there are some details you have to consider ahead of the event, and each of these units requires dedicated volunteers. Therefore, once you have gathered your team and enough funding to cover your primary expenses (e.g., venue, catering), then you will be ready to start planning the event. Please read the How to Guideline before you decide on the scope of the event you will run on your site. 

  - question: Where can I find the How to Guideline for the organization of a local Brainhack event as part of Brainhack Global? 
    answer: |
      [Here](https://github.com/brainhackorg/pr-material)! We already created one, but please do not hesitate to give us your feedback so we can add/improve the materials.

  - question: Can we schedule our own program?
    answer: |
      Of course! Each local Brainhack event is free to create its program; you are even free to choose a specific theme (e.g., atlas segmentation). Nonetheless, the program often follows a general framework, including activities that foster productive collaborations and create an excellent working atmosphere, allowing attendees to interactively learn new skills while working on (one or more) projects. These activities include, but are not limited to: an introduction to Brainhack (Global) (brainhacking 101), project pitches, (open) hacking, unconferences, wrap-ups and feedback, and social events/special activities (ice breakers). 

  - question: Could we have projects that do not include coding but are focused on developing guidelines, protocols, or documents?
    answer: |
      This is your event, and you are the one to decide. In our opinion, any project facilitating collaboration, openness, and reproducibility within the (open) neuroscience community is eligible and should be supported. 

  - question: Could we use our own visuals and logo?
    answer: |
      It certainly is fun to have different logos for each of the participating sites. However, this is optional, and you are welcome to use the Brainhack Global logos provided [here](https://github.com/brainhackorg/pr-material). If you choose to create your logo, please follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.brainhack.org/code-of-conduct.html): make sure that the logos do not offend any group of society or individuals by any means and/or create any conflicting ideas on political opinions, race and gender discriminations. 

  - question: Will we get technical support on implementing the website and setting up the broadcasting?
    answer: |
      We are not able to provide each local Brainhack site with a personalized website for their event, but event holders will receive a general template that can be easily personalized with their event’s information. If you have any difficulties adapting the template, you can contact us through our email at brainhackorg@gmail.com, and we will do our best to help you. Likewise, we won’t be able to oversee the presentation broadcasting at each local Brainhack site individually, but we will provide you with general information on how to set up the necessary infrastructure.

  - question: Where can we access the previous tutorials? Could we use those tutorials in our events?
    answer: |
      You can access the list of previous years’ event holders and their websites from [here](http://brainhack.org/). As is the case now, each site had its program and schedule, and some of them made their tutorials publicly available. Those are still accessible through the events’ past websites. Please do not hesitate to check the tutorials and to use the materials by citing the original authors/creators. 

  - question: What type of support will I get from the Brainhack Global team?
    answer: |
      Once you declare your interest in running an event by sending an email to brainhackorg@gmail.com, our Brainhack Global team will contact you with several questions about the planned event. We will also provide you with a welcome pack that includes:

      * How to Guideline;
      * instructions for building your website;
      * checklist for the duties to run;
      * code for the website template;
      * registration form questionnaire;
      * PR materials: Brainhack logo and color scheme;
      * list of open science tools and materials you can use in your own tutorial production;
      * code for the attendee selection (in the case of a high number of applications);
      * instructions for broadcasting.

      Once you confirm that you will host an event, the Brainhack Global team will give you the support you need (i.e., as much as our volunteer team is able to provide). It is recommended to keep the Brainhack Global team up to date with your plans and preparations to swiftly get the support you need. 

  - question: Could we use the tutorials/materials from recent years or other event sites?
    answer: |
      Yes, you can access the materials from recent years from the event sites’ websites listed [here](http://brainhack.org). Please do not forget to cite the materials’ developer(s) in your presentations which will help the acknowledgment of data sharing and open science while respecting the amount of work done by the leading developer(s). 

  - question: May I work with a commercial sponsor?
    answer: |
      Yes. Please, do not forget that the involvement of any third party supplies and sponsors in the organization of your event is under your responsibility as the event hosting site. Those relationships are not bound to the Brainhack Global organization, and we, unfortunately, cannot take any responsibility for the sponsorship of the hosting sites with third party organizations and companies. 

  - question: Can I distribute stickers/T-shirts/goodies to the attendees for free or sell them?
    answer: |
      Yes. For free giveaways, we recommend you to use your resources wisely and to make sure that you have enough leftovers to spend on those giveaways after the main issues (i.e., venue, catering, printing materials, potentially travel awards) are solved. For selling, again it is up to the hosting site. We would recommend making sure that the money handling is audited and appropriately done abiding by the financial legislation and rules of the institute/country/state you are associated.

  - question: What should I do to prevent/take action against if we are informed on the existence of an action/abuse that violates the Code of Conduct?
    answer: |
      As an event organizer, you have the responsibility to ensure the good conduct of your event as well as the safety of your attendees. First of all, you have to make sure that the attendees read the Code of Conduct and are clear on the terms declared in it. Based on the scope of the incident and the laws of the hosting country/state, you might need to seek advice from the legal consultants of your institute regarding on how to act in the case of possible incidents. For more recommendations, please have a look at the associated section in the How to Guideline.
